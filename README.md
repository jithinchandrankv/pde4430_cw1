#           MOBILE ROBOTICS

PDE4430_COURSE WORK 1

Aim

   To move a mobile robot in a meaningful way using the
Robotic Operating System (ROS) , the TurtleSim and perform various task like:

 • Teleoperation using the keyboard, with an option to
change movement speed

• Autonomous navigation to any given coordinate in the
Turtlesim window

• Avoiding wall collision – Override movement if wall
hitting is imminent

• Vacuum Cleaning behaviour – Covering the entire window
in an efficient manner

• Multiple turtles vacuum cleaning behaviour – 2 is good, 3
or more is great



## Installation

In this course work , created a specific package name pde4430_cw1 inside catkin_ws.Added scripts inside the src file.
Added seperate python file for each task .To run this package,always to run  "roscore" and"rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node" in the terminal box.




## Task 1 :  Teleoperation using the keyboard

   In this task , turtle will controlled using keyboard keys.Also speed will adjust with help of key.For that , need to run turtlesim_node and teleoperator.py. file in the terminal.

   while running terminal display the which direction is pressed.
