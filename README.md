PDE4430_COURSE WORK 1

Aim

   To move a mobile robot in a meaningful way using the
Robotic Operating System (ROS) , the TurtleSim and perform various task like

• Teleoperation using the keyboard, with an option to
change movement speed

• Autonomous navigation to any given coordinate in the
Turtlesim window

• Avoiding wall collision – Override movement if wall
hitting is imminent
